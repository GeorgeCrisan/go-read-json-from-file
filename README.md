Run with 

```go run main.go```

Or alternatively you can use hot reload.

I use air for development [Hot reload with air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)

Install 
```
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
``` 

add ```alias air='~/go/bin/air'```

restart shell

cd in the root directory and do

```
air
```
